    <div class="abouttextsection"><p id="tribute-info" class="abouttext"><a id="tribute-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Bennington">Chester Charles Bennington</a> was an American singer, songwriter, musician, and actor. He served as lead singer for the bands Linkin Park, Dead by Sunrise, Grey Daze, and Stone Temple Pilots. He was widely regarded as one of the top rock vocalists of the 2000s. Bennington first gained prominence as a vocalist following the release of Linkin Park's debut album, Hybrid Theory, in 2000, which became a commercial success. The album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2005, making it the best-selling debut album of the decade, as well as one of the few albums ever to hit that many sales. Linkin Park's following studio albums, from Meteora to One More Light, continued the band's success. Linkin Park has sold over 100 million records worldwide.
<br>On July 20, 2017, Bennington was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California. His death was ruled as suicide by hanging.</p>
